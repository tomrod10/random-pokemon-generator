# random-pokemon-generator

This random Pokemon generator fetches data from all the available Pokemon in the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

I wanted to learn and practice TailwindCSS and TypeScript, so I chose a simple project.

P.S. I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) in its last days, hence why it lags a bit on video!
